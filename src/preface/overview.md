You found the book! Well, you found *a* book. It's only *the* book if you're looking for a description of lovingly-curated Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) practices.

That's not to say that it's a book you shouldn't read if you're not looking for that. It's just that if that's what you're looking for, you have definitely found that book. Go you. Keep being awesome.

Having said that, let's go ahead and take care of some questions that you might have.

## What is BDD? ##

That's a really, really good question. I've seen about as many definitions as I've seen practitioners. Here's how I'd define it:

> Behavior-Driven Development is the practice by which we describe the desired behavior of a piece of software (as a whole, as a component, etc), then write just enough code to make that description a reality.

If you're anything like me at a point before I started being such a pedantic tester, that might seen completely backwards. How are we supposed to observe and test behavior that doesn't exist?

We'll get to that later. For now, just trust me, it's great.

## Just Who Do I Think I Am? ##

Hi there, I'm Dennis. We probably don't know each other very well, so here's a list of short anecdotes that come to mind:

* When I was a **CHILD** child, I liked climbing the small tree at the end of our back yard. Unfortunately, I was also obsessed with Superman. One broken arm later, I no longer loved climbing that tree, and it was only years later that I learned a bit of nuance: when a child insists that an injury wasn't caused by falling out of a tree and pauses just a bit too long before declaring "***I JUMPED***," doctors get very squirrely.
* In grade 8, my first real mentor, a great science teacher by the name of Michael Heard, told me that I'd be doing the world a disservice if I didn't become an engineer. That was a million years ago, though, so I'm guessing he wanted me to build bridges or something. That would have been cool and all, but that's not how life panned out. I did learn a very important lesson from Mr. Heard. "*The answer to almost any curiosity is multiplication: multiply what you know by what you don't know, then solve for `X`*."
* In high school, I decided that I wanted to do this whole software developering thing for a living. That didn't work out in a timely manner at all, but it was still an activity that I loved, and everybody needs hobbies, you know?
* In college, Spanish was my major subject of study. I often say that this is because I wanted to teach, and that's true, but I also kinda wanted to be the guy on the Spanish language learning tapes. ***El queso es viejo y rubio. The cheese is old and blonde.*** This did lead to a great interaction with another mentor, a CS instructor by the name of Dr. Bruce Mabis. Dr. Mabis was big on participation in his classes, but most of his students had fairly little exposure to computering, so I got to talk a lot (just like right now). The thing is, I sometimes gloss over details, and he called me on this after I misused a term while describing the nitty gritty of binary trees in class. None of us had ever heard the man yell before his reaction to my response: I'm a Spanish major, man, cut me a little slack.
* After realizing that I totally didn't want to teach in the traditional sense, I spent some time doing anything but that and developering for a living. I worked in fast food, hospitality, telecom call center repair, logistics (which is a very fancy way to say that I moved heavy stuff onto trucks), UNIX and Linux system administration, web hosting, and all sorts of things. These days, I'm developering for a living. It was a long road to get there, but I eventually landed on one of my two plans for post-academic life.
* When I'm not stuck in front of a computerbox, I enjoy building (but not playing) cigar box guitars, hanging out with my dog, Jake, hanging out with my spouse, and occasionally taking off for random last-minute road trips.

## Just Who Do I Think You Are? ##

Hi there, you're you. As I see it, there are a few possibilities as to who you are:

* You might be a friend or colleague that I've asked to read over this book to help me figure out how to most effectively communicate the ideas that I'm presenting. *(I probably owe you ice cream or something.)*
* You might be a relatively new software developer that needs to figure out this whole software testing (and maybe even design) thing. *(Hello, young person! Good luck, and reach out if I can help.)*
* You might be a seasoned software developer that is looking for a different approach to software testing (and maybe even design). *(Hey, bud! How's it going?)*
* You might even be a person that hasn't touched a computer before, but has an incredible desire to learn about a ton of topics. *(I'm totally the same way. Welcome!)*

Regardless of who you are, I very much hope that you enjoy the ride.

## Why Write This? ##

There are a few reasons. 

For one, I'm pretty confident (and dare I say proud) of where I am with my testing practices today. In line with what Mr. Heard said back in 19-diggity-3, it would be kind of a jerk move to not spread knowledge that has served me to great benefit.

For another, I've been having a lot of conversations with coworkers lately about helping to get some of these practices adopted at the company that I've recently joined, and it's way easier to have things written down than to say them repeatedly. As it were, one of the core concepts of the company is that "we are a company that writes things down." Seems like a good idea to me.

These people greatly helped me along the way by reading the various iterations to make content suggestions, point out things that I've forgotten, increase readability and comprehensibility, or even just finding typos.

These are good people. You should find them and listen to the things that they have to say as well.

## A Few Caveats ##

As seems to be the case with all books like this one, there are a few things that should probably be stated up front:

* I don't definitely know what I'm talking about. I think I know pretty well what I'm talking about, and this is the only time that I'll even hint that I might not be an expert in the subject, but these are just *my* ideas about software testing in the end. If this is a topic that's as important to you as it is to me, I'd urge you to consume any media you can find about it.
* One thing in which I'm definitely not an expert is writing. Please do forgive typos, incomprehensible idioms, and things like that. I was a Spanish major, man, cut me a little slack. If I'm very lucky, this whole thing will seem more like a conversation than a textbook.
* My BDD story started half a million years ago with Ruby. These days, I'm more likely to be dealing with Go. When I start giving examples, I'll likely go predominantly with Ruby for the ease of illustration (and the thing where it already often looks like pseudocode), but I'll also include a chapter about applying these ideas to languages that aren't quite as squishy as Ruby, so I'll switch to Go.
